# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that lets you track progress, review and undo changes and create backups. It also lets you view the history of revisions to one or more files and allows the merging of revisions made by several people. It is useful for keeping the original code free of mistakes while changes are made that may or may not work out.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the project you are working on. You would use one to make sure nothing goes wrong when changes are made before pushing the updates to the original code.

* Whats is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point for the project you are working on. A good commit message is specific and states what was changed since the last commit. Best practice is to write everything in present tense.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches change the same file and try to merge them together.
