<!--
-The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to explicitly describe its meaning to the browser and the developer. I would probably find the nav tag the most useful. Most websites have a navigation bar somewhere on the page.
-Browsers will read the elements from top to bottom.
-Being able to create my own snippets would definitely come in handy if I have a set layout I always use to create websites. I would definitely create more at a later date.
-The most difficult part of this challenge was figuring out how to use the HTML5 semantic tags. We found it difficult to locate a reference that explained the elements in a way that wasn't confusing. I will have to do some more research and our guide also promised us a resource he used a lot so hopefully they will make more sense soon.
